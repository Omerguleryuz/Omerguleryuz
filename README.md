# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ã–mer, a passionate game developer with experience in Unity and C#. I've been developing and publishing mobile games and improving myself day by day.
I made two mobile games so far. I am sharing their links below. I also sent one of these games to a publisher and we made tests together. 

## Game Links
## Find the Difference: Spot It!

We have made a find the difference game with my team. It includes 25 categories that work like chapters in the game. There are approximately 400 levels. There are high quality images in each level. We tried to make the UI 
in cartoon style and attractive. There are two types of levels which we call normal and timed levels. 
In normal levels, there is no time limitation. The player has three lives and tries to find the 7 differences between the two images. In timed levels, the player has 30 seconds to find the 7 hidden objects in one image.

We added a lucky wheel (player watches a rewarded ad to spin it), daily rewards, shop, settings IAP, ads, etc.

## Hidden Object: Master

We have made a hidden object game where player finds the hidden objects in different chapters like mansion, museum, etc. There is no time limitation and also player can get help from hint button.

## Dodger Ball

This is a hypercasual, relaxing, chill game. The player drags and releases the ball and tries to reach the top of the level to complete it. There are obstacles such as swinging axes, wrecking balls, saws,
spikes, moving blocks, etc.

## Current Projects

- I am making a hidden object game and I am about to publish it. I kept the game simple and just made 15 levels to see the retention rates and play times.
I added Admob, Firebase Analytics and Cloud Messaging, Unity Analytics, Facebook and In-app rating SDK of Google Play Services.
I also added a few custom events to see how many levels will players complete.
